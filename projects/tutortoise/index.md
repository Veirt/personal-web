Tutortoise is a platform designed to connect learners with the right tutors —
based on subject, budget, availability, and preferred learning style (online or
on-site). It was developed as part of the Bangkit 2024 program.

## Overview

I contributed to the backend development, which was built using TypeScript (with
Bun), Express.js, and PostgreSQL. We deployed the services on Google Cloud
Platform using Docker and Terraform. Some of the things I worked on is designing and implementing core REST APIs,
handling authentication and user management. This was a collaborative project involving students from the Machine Learning,
Mobile Development, and Cloud Computing learning paths. It was one of the most
cross-functional teams I’ve worked with, and I learned a lot from building
something meaningful together from scratch.
