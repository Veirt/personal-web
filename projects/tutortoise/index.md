## Tutortoise: Your Perfect Tutor is Around You

Tutortoise is a platform that helps connect learners with the right tutors
based on their needsâ€”covering subject matter, budget, schedule, and preferred
learning method (online or on-site). It was built during the Bangkit 2024
program with a strong focus on accessibility and personalized learning.

I worked on the backend side of Tutortoise. The backend was built using
TypeScript, Bun, Express.js, and PostgreSQL, and deployed on Google Cloud
Platform using Docker and Terraform. I helped integrate several services into
the backend, including machine learning endpoints and moderation systems. I
also worked on designing and implementing core APIs, handling authentication,
and ensuring the backend could scale and deploy smoothly.

This project was a team effort, and I had the chance to collaborate with
amazing members from Machine Learning, Mobile Development, and Cloud Computing
learning paths. It was a great opportunity to learn how to build something
together as a cross-functional team.
