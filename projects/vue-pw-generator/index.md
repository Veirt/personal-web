A simple single-page app built to generate secure passwords based on user-selected criteria.  
This was my first time working with Vue and TailwindCSS, and a hands-on way to explore frontend state management and component-driven architecture.

The app supports:

- Selecting character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
- Adjusting password length
- Generating and displaying passwords instantly
