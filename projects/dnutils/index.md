**dnutils** is a bunch of command-line tools I made for modding and poking
around in the game _Dragon Nest_. Back then, I was using a mix of random tools,
some outdated, some sketchy, some just annoying to use, so I decided to make
my own set that actually works the way I want.

Honestly, I also just wanted to learn Rust and make _something_ with it because
it looked cool. So this became my excuse. The tools can unpack and repack game
assets, inspect files, and convert some of the formats the game uses.
It's not super polished or anything, but it works.
